## Description

Finding the perfect gift for the people we love can either become the easiest or the hardest task of our lives at a given moment. We all have people who we love but have hardships finding out what would be the most ideal and useful present for them when the occasion comes, such as Christmas or birthdays. 

Our team has decided to create an application that solves the struggle of present choosing and helps you maintain your list of “goals”. Wish lists are often present on websites, allowing you to save the desired item for a later purchase. However, having all those items saved on numerous different websites can be confusing and time consuming.

The purpose of the list that our team is going to develop is to save all the trouble and have one safe place where you can create different lists, saving the items onto it, which can be later edited and  distributed between friends and family, making the present shopping hustle a little less bad of an experience. It will also help you store all your ideas at one place, without having to worry about the exact website where you saw something interesting and whether is still in stock or not.

The must haves of the app are the ability to create a user in the application, login, and managing wish items.  This includes moving, editing, and removing items of the list.  The user should also be able to add new products to this lists, and only the creator of the list should have those permissions.  Things that the app could have if a registry of all the items bought, so that the user can see what items have been already bought, and maybe the ability to contact the developer.  This application will not include ads for monetization since it is a prototype
